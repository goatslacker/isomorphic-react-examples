> Isomorphic react application using flux.

## Running This

```sh
npm install; npm run build; npm start
```

Then open your browser to `localhost:8080` and enjoy.

## What

The purpose of this application is to show how an isomorphic react application using flux works with [iso](https://github.com/goatslacker/iso).

For this guide we’ll be creating an isomorphic product search app, using react-table-view and a simple search bar. Let’s get started.
