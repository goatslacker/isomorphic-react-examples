# iso-react-router-flux-movies

> Isomorphic react application using flux and react-router

## Running This

```sh
npm install; npm run build; npm start
```

Then open your browser to `localhost:8080` and enjoy.

There are a few routes you can visit directly:

`localhost:8080/movies` and `localhost:8080/movie/`. 

Movies will display a list of the movies whereas movie will display all the info for an individual movie... e.g. Gleaming the Cube
