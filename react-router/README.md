# iso-react-router-flux

> Isomorphic react application using flux and react-router

## Running This

```sh
npm install; npm run build; npm start
```

Then open your browser to `localhost:8080` and enjoy.

There are a few routes you can visit directly:

`localhost:8080/hello` and `localhost:8080/time`. Hello will display a hello message whereas time will display the current time.

For funsies you can include your own name as a parameter to hello: eg `localhost:8080/hello/jane` This will be seeded on the server and bootstrapped on the client.
